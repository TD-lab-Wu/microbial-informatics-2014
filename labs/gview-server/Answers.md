### Question 1

The following table shows a comparison of the BLAST atlas for both chromosomes.

| Chromosome I                     | Chromosome II                        |
|:--------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| ![lab1a-atlas][lab2-atlas-1.jpg] | ![lab1b-atlas][lab2-atlas-2.jpg]     |

A few differences include:

* Chromosome I is ~3 mbp in length where as Chromosome II is ~1 mbp in length.
* VC-1 on Chromosome I has a small region around position 100 kbp which is missing when compared to 2010EL-1786 and 2010EL-1749.
* Chromosome I contains a number of small gaps missing from all genomes (for example around 2150 kbp).  These correspond to RNA regions which were not selected to be displayed in the **Customize Appearance** screen.

### Question 1

The following table shows a comparison of the BLAST Atlas and the pan-genome BLAST Atlas.

| BLAST Atlas                      | Pan-genome BLAST Atlas         |
|:--------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| ![blast atlas][lab2-atlas-1.jpg] | ![pan atlas][lab3-atlas-1.jpg] |

The differences between the BLAST Atlas and the pan-genome BLAST Atlas include:

* Chromosome II of 2010EL-1786 is appended on the end of Chromosome I within the Pan-genome BLAST Atlas.
* There is a small, extra region not found on Chromosome I or II of 2010EL-1786, but that is found on VC-1 that is appended on the end of Chromosome II.

### Question 2

The following table shows a comparison of the pan-genome BLAST Atlas using both Chromosomes as the seed genome.

| Seed: Chromosome I                 | Seed: Chromosome II                    |
|:----------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
| ![lab2-atlas-c1][lab3-atlas-1.jpg] | ![lab2-atlas-c2][lab3-atlas-2.jpg]     |

The main difference is with the positions of features on the pan-genome.  Starting with a seed genome of Chromosome II places Chromosome II at the very beginning of the atlas (from position 0 kbp to 1000 kbp).

### Question 2

1. The 3269 genes that are part of the core genome set from the OrthoMCL analysis correspond to all the places in the pan-genome BLAST Atlas containing coloured blocks in every single slot.  Since most of the BLAST Atlas contains coloured blocks in every slot then both the pan-genome BLAST Atlas and the OrthoMCL analysis appear fairly consistent.

2. This unique region of 74 genes found in every genome except C6706 corresponds to a number of different regions in this BLAST Atlas.  These include:

    1. The region around 200 kbp.

    2. The region around 2950 kbp.

    ![2950][lab4-2950.jpg]

    3. The region around 3940 kbp.

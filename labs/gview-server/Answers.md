1. The following table shows a comparison of the BLAST atlas for both chromosomes.

| Chromosome I                           | Chromosome II                          |

A few differences include:

* Chromosome I is ~3 mbp in length where as Chromosome II is ~1 mbp in length.
* VC-1 on Chromosome I has a small region around position 100 kbp which is missing when compared to 2010EL-1786 and 2010EL-1749.
* Chromosome I contains a number of small gaps missing from all genomes (for example around 2150 kbp).  These correspond to RNA coding regions which were not selected to be displayed in the **Customize Appearance** screen.

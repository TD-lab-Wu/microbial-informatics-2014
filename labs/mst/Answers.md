1. Viewing the location data should give you an image that looks like the following.

   ![mlst location](images/lab2-location.jpg)

2. Below are some example screenshots from running goeBURST at each of the different levels.

   * DLV

   ![dlv](images/lab2-level2.jpg)

   * TLV

   [tlv](images/lab2-level3.jpg)

   * Full MST

   ![full mst](images/lab2-full-mlst.jpg)

   The differences would be that more isolates are included within the same groups as the levels (DLV, TLV) increases.  With the Full MST, every isolate is connected within the same group.
